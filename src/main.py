# TODO:
#
# - Write function to integrate with Google Calendar API and collect schedule data
# - Create an intelligently formatted data structure to store scheduled events and important metadata about each. See the next point.
# - Create a datastructure which stores tags/traits/past data and tie these to the above data structure.

# DESIRED FUNCTIONALITY:
# - The software should be able to return the number of 'usable' or 'productive' hours left in a given timespan, based on past behaviour (and maybe some science)
# - The software should be able to add new events to an existing Google Calendar
# - The software should be able to categorize inputted tasks (based on increasingly few inputs) and schedule an appropriate time for it based on past data
