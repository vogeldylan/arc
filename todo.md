# Goals

1. Free time until next event
2. Call next event of type ___ (e.g. test, exam)
    * Also do #1
3. Search for an event
    * Enter name (could be part of name)
    * Map a # to event for easy entry.
4. Create and insert event
    * Also do #1

## Data Structures

* For now, will use Pickles with a custom event class storing:
    1. Start time
    2. End time
    3. Type
    4. Priority
* Class will store a list of events from API and/or table calls.
* Table will be implemented with some other structure (e.g. some flavour of SQL, Mango DB, etc.)
